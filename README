    Install git. In the terminal, type "sudo apt-get install git"

    Install the g++ compiler by running “sudo apt-get install g++”

    EagleTree uses some boost libraries. In order to install them easily, you can use the synaptic package manager. In the terminal, run “sudo apt-get install synaptic”. Then open the visual interface to synaptic, and search “boost serial”. Mark in install the package “libboost-serialization-dev”. Its description should be “serialization library for C++ (default version)”. Install this package and its dependencies.

    EagleTree also uses the Graphical Layout Engine (gle) to generate visual output. To get gle, open the synaptic package manager again and search for "gle-graphics". You should see version 4.2.4. Install this package. Note that some of the graphical output will not get generated if you use an older version of gle.

    In the EagleTree main folder in your workstation, run the command “make all -j”. EagleTree should now start building. The -j option is used to speed up the building process.
